1. When inserting or updating BLOB or TEXT columns, Connector/C++ developers are advised not to use setString(). Instead, use the dedicated setBlob() API function.
   The use of setString() can cause a Packet too large error message. The error occurs if the length of the string passed to the connector using setString() exceeds
   max_allowed_packet(minus a few bytes reserved in the protocol for control purposes). This situation is not handled in
   Connector/C++, because it could lead to security issues, such as extremely large memory allocation
   requests due to malevolently long strings.
   If setBlob() is used, this problem does not arise because setBlob() takes a streaming approach based on std::istream. When sending the data from the stream to the MySQL
   server, Connector/C++ splits the stream into chunks appropriate for the server using the current max_allowed_packet setting.
   
   Caution
	When using setString(), it is not possible to set max_allowed_packet
	to a value large enough for the string prior to passing it to Connector/C++.
	That configuration option cannot be changed within a session.
	

2. g++ -o mysql_cpp_api mysql_cppapi.cpp -lmysqlcppconn 

3. sudo apt install libmysqlcppconn-dev
